    <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>

    <p>
      In this project, we first learned how to use the De Casteljau's algorithm to find Bezier Curves and Surfaces. In part 2, we used Phong Shading, edge flip, and split to
      do mesh upsampling. We spent a lot of time debugging q6, but the problem showed up in our splitting phase. The upsampling is also very useful in a sense that when we are
      in the process of modeling, adding edges will change the balance when smoothing the object. The Bezier Curves part is a little bit boring comparing to part 2. Overall, it's
      more fun and useful comparing to project 1, thanks for the detailed instructions and resources in the spec this time.

    <h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier curves with 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>

    <p>De Casteljau's algorithm is used to find a point on a Bezier Curve by recursively cutting lines with a certain ratio. Given n points with n-1 splines,
      we can therefore subdivide each of the line into two parts: t and 1-t, with a point. such point can be labeled as p_1'...p_(n-1)'. t is a parameter that
      can be adjusted from 0 to 1. We repeated this process recursively for every single line, and our final points will be on the Bezier curve, as desired.
      In our implementation, in order to get the points for the next subdivision level, we calculate p’ for each point with the
      formula p_i‘ = (1 - t)p_i + tp_(i + 1) recursively. Here is our own Bezier curve with 6 control points of our choosing (step 1-7). 8 is the screenshot of a
      slightly different Bezier curve.

    <h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier surfaces with separable 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>

        <p>First, since controlPoints is 2D n*n, for each row of control points, we calculate their Bezier curves and find points that lies on the Bezier curves
          respectively with respect to then u dimension. With all of those points that lie on those Bezier curves,
          we calculate the Bezier curve with these points with respect to the parameter v. In this case, we will have a
          n*n points to generate the Bezier surfaces. This is very similar to the de Casteljau algorithm in q1, we basically extends to Bezier surfaces
          by recursively calling the evaluate1D function. In our implemention, we loop through the rows of controlPoints in the evaluate function by repeatedly
          calling evaluate1D, which will get the points on Bezier curves until the middle one is found. In this way, all Bezier curves in the u dimension are done,
          and we then run evaluate1D function one last time with the scalar interpolation parameter t, which will generate the final Bezier surface.

    <h3 align="middle">Part 3: Average normals for half-edge meshes</h3>
    <p>
      For each face, we first get the three vertices associated with it.
      Then, we subtract two pairs of these three vertices and cross multiply
      them to get the normal vector that’s pointing out from the surface. A normal of a face is a vector perpendicular to the surface
      at a given point, and we know that the cross product of two vectors along the face can produce a third vector perpendicular to the two vectors,
      which is in a correct direction and can be used as a normal after normalization. Therefore, in our implemention, for each mesh, we start with a HalfedgeCIter h.
      Looping and summing through the halfedge edge, we first get a vertex v0 with h->vertex(), a vertex v1 with h_twin->vertex(), and a vertex v2 with h_twin->next()->next()->vertex(),
      then we calcualte the cross product of between v1 - v2 and v3 - v1 for a area-weighted normal. Doing this for all neighboring faces, and we have the correct normals for the meshes.

    <h3 align="middle">Part 4: Half-edge flip</h3>
    <p> To flip a half-edge, we need to disconnect the current half-edge, connect the other two vertices that haven't been connected,
      and reassign all the related pointers. Each time, we ignore the boundary cases by checking isBoundary().
      According to the recommend steps, for step 1, we draw a diagram to show the half edges before and after the flip, and
      retrieve all the halfedges, faces, and vertices. In our implemention, we simply created variabel for each vertex, edge, halfedge, face and updated according to the
      graph. starting with halfedges and vertices, then with properties to all the halfedges (next, face, setNeighbors).

    <h3 align="middle">Part 5: Half-edge split</h3>
      <p>
Similar to q4, we draw the diagram first to keep track of the changes for each component. After splitting the shared edge
of the original two triangles, there are new faces and edges introduced accordingly. It's very easy to create new but not
necessary faces during our coding, and it's very hard to keep track on what we've already reassigned because the half-edges
go through a cycle. In our implemention, we first remembered all the original variables, saved cb as cm, bc as bm, created new edges and halfedges
for mb and mc. After finishing the split on point m, we also created new edges and halfedges horizontally by adding am, md, dm, ma, and the vertex m itself with position (b+c)/2.
we reassign abcd just in case. Then we created 2 new faces, and reassign halfedge, face, setNeighbors, and etc according to the graph.

    <h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop subdivision for mesh upsampling</h3>
    <p>
      Following the steps in the instructions, we calcualted the update old vertices positions by looping through
      the original mesh vertices. save n as degree, if n == 3, u == 3/16, else u == 3.0 / (8.0 * n) according to
      the value suggestions. We started from the first halfedge. Begining with the original position and summing all the vertex positions around the existing vertex, used
      (1.0 - n * u) * current_position + u * sum to update the position. Then we stored new v position for every vertices after assigning weights with 3/8 * (a+b) + 1/8 * (c+d) in
      a vector new_v_positions. Up until this point, all isNew attribute of vertices are false.
      Now we started the process of splitting every edge in the mesh with the splitEdge function. Splitting every edge and mark all the new edges with its isNew property and
      getting the new vertex, we updated its newPosition to what we've stored in
      new_v_positions and created new halfedges within it. Then for the last major part, we flip the edge if its new and one of its the two vertices is not new.
      We also copied and updated these new vertex positions into final Vertex::position.

    <p>
      By looking at the Fig 6.3: upsample original, and comparing it with Fig 6.4-6.7, we observed an asymmetric pattern after subdivision.
      With the original mesh being asymmetrical, it's clear that after the process of subdivision, for corners
      that have fewers edges connecting (in different degrees n), the outcomes look sharp after upsampling. To update the position,
      we used  (1.0 - n * u) * current_position + u * sum to update the position, which is dependent on these degrees.
      Since we calcualte the new vertex with (v0->position + v1->position)/2.0, v2 and v3, although with similar geometrical pattern,
      have an imbalanced topologicial representation. By pre-splitting and increasing symmetry of the meshes,
      we can resolve this issue easily. Belows are samples with splitting the diagonal edges for every single face and then do upsampling.
