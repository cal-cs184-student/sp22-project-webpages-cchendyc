<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>
This is the best/most fun project in this class throughout the semester. In this project, we implement a stimulation of cloth and its related movements.
There are two main parts: Tasks 1-4 and Tasks 5. 1-4 is focusing on creating the masses and spring on the cloth, putting the forces between a
pair of point masses, and collisions with other objects and cloth itself. 5 is for making different kind of shadings (diffuse, pong, texture mapping,
bumping&displacement, and mirror) for the cloth with GLSL shader programs.
</p>

<!-- Take some screenshots of scene/pinned2.json from a viewing angle where you can
clearly see the cloth wireframe to show the structure of your point masses and springs.
Show us what the wireframe looks like
(1) without any shearing constraints
(2) with only shearing constraints
and (3) with all constraints. -->
<h2 align="middle">Part I: Masses and springs</h2>
<p>
For this part, we first implemented the a grid of masses by iterating through num_height_points in
the outer loop and num_width_points in the inner loop. We calacuted height and width for each point
given height and weight of the grid before everything starts. Using these information, we can get the
x and y positions for each point in the nested loop. According to the spec, if the orientation is vertical
we set z to a small random offset between -1/1000 and 1/1000, else if the orientation is horizontal,
we set z to y and y to 1.0. Now the position for the pointMass (x, y, z) is known, we use emplace_back to
put it into the end of point_masses with pinned setted to false. After the looping, we iterate through the pinned
list and set the pinned of all the pointMass inside to true.
</p>
<p>
  Then we start to implement springs between each 2 masses with Structural (left + above),
  Shearing (diagonal upper left + diagonal upper right), and Bending (2 away to its left + 2 above)
  constraints. For each time of constraint, we use a nested for loop again with targeted point such
  as (x-1, y) and (x, y-1) for Structural, (x-1, y-1) and (x+1, y-1) for Shearing, (x-2, y) and (x, y-2)
  for Bending given the top left mass is supposed to be at coordinate (0, 0).
  We check if our targeted masses are within 0 and number of points for their width and height
  to avoid edge (literally) cases. We used y * num_width_points + x to locate the mass in the point_masses
  and use emplace_back again for adding new spring with correct constraints into the springs vector.
  Here are some screenshots of scene/pinned2.json from a viewing angle
  where we can clearly see the cloth wireframe, showing the structure of our point masses and springs.

Experiment with some the parameters in the simulation.
To do so, pause the simulation at the start with P,
modify the values of interest,
and then resume by pressing P again.
You can also restart the simulation at any time from the cloth's starting position by pressing R.

Describe the effects of changing the spring constant ks;
how does the cloth behave from start to rest with a
very low ks?
A high ks?

What about for density?
What about for damping?

For each of the above, observe any noticeable differences in the cloth compared to the
default parameters and show us some screenshots of those interesting differences
and describe when they occur.

Show us a screenshot of your shaded cloth from scene/pinned4.json in its final resting state!
If you choose to use different parameters than the default ones, please list them. -->
<h2 align="middle">Part 2: Simulation via numerical integration</h2>
<p>
In this part, we first compute the total force acting on each point mass by initializing
the forces of each pointMass to the sum of mass*a starting from (0, 0, 0),
with all a in external_accelerations for external forces (such as gravity). We check the constraint type, and use
<pre align="middle">
  F_s = k_s * (||p_a - p_b||-l)
</pre>
to calcuate the force to the two masses. Since the bending constraint should be
weaker that structural or shearing constraints, according to the spec, we multiple
additional 0.2 to ks if the spring type is bending. We apply F_s to pm_a and -F_s to
pm_b. Then we compute the positions of new point mass using Verlet integration with
<pre align="middle">
  x_(t+dt) = x_t + (1-d) * (x_t - x_(t-dt)) + a_t * dt^2
</pre>
if the point mass is not pinned. Here x_(t-dt) is the position from the last time step,
which we saved in last_position before updated the position.
Lastly, we update the constrain position according to the SIGGRAPH 1995 Provot paper to
avoid over deformation. we check the ratio of
(spring's length - rest_length) and its rest_length, and if it's greater than 10%, we
impose a correction using distance reduction to the unpinned point mass. In other word, we add such correction
to b if a is pinned, a if b is pinned, half and half to a and b if both unpinned, and none
if both are pinned. Here is the cloth with all the default parameters for pinned2.json.

<p>
For detailed analysis, we first experiment with some the parameters in the simulation by
pausing the simulation at the start with P, modify the values of interest, and then resume by pressing P again.</p>
<p>
Here we first change the spring constant ks with low, medium, high, superhigh ks using pinned2.json with default density
and damping. From left to right below, we have ks increasing from 10, 1000, 10,000 to 100,000. Comparing to the above cloth with
the default parameters, which looks very much like a cloth in reality, the flexibleness changes from high to low.
Given ks is the stiffness of the spring, it's not surprise to see when it's low (left), the cloth looks more malleable
and are highly affected by gravity, whereas when ks is high (right), the stretching of
springs between 2 masses looks more rigid.

<!-- What about for density? -->
<p>
Keeping every other parameters as default, we then test for density from 1500, 150, 15, to 1.5.
Density is used when calculating the mass of each point masses and contribute in the external forces of each pm.
When the density is high, the mass is high, the force on each mass is high, a.k.a the cloth will be affected more
by external forces gravity. Therefore, we can see a similar pattern (but in reverse) as ks from the density change.
With high density (left), the deformation by gravity is very obvious, whereas for low density (right), the
deformation is less obvious. Density can be intepreted as the weight of the cloth in this case given the gravity
is our major external forces.

<p>
  Next, we look at damping, which is a description of how the cloth and the spring
  in-between each pair of point masses are resisting the movements from external force, a.k.a the moving
  tendency. With damping=0 (right), the cloth has lower stability towards movements. It suddenly drops from the
  top with a high speed once released and takes longer (almost forever) to come to its resting state.
  This is related to the low level of energy loss. When damping=1 (left), the stability is high so the cloth drops with
  a slow speed and takes shorter to come to its resting state. It doesn't oscillate back and forth at all.
  It's hard to see with screenshots because damping is related to motion, so we posed 2 gif on the website and a
  quick preview png for the pdf reader.

to show custom colors.) -->
<h2 align="middle">Part 3: Handling collisions with other objects</h2>
<p>
  For this part, we implement cloth's collisions with other objects such as sphere and plane. The idea is fairly
  easy: if with find our position intersects/inside of a sphere or goes from one side of the plane to the other for the plane,
  we adjust the position to the tangent point with a correction vector scaled down by 1-friction. Here is some screenshots
  of our shaded cloth from scene/sphere.json in its final resting state on the sphere with default parameters.
  We uses ks = 500, ks = 5000, and and ks = 50000. Clealy, as we mentioned in part2, since ks represents the stiffness of
  the cloth, with a smaller ks, the cloth will wrap around the sphere more closely because its ability of being stretched and
  adhered is strong than the cloth with a higher ks. For cloth with a larger ks, there are less creases because it is stiff
  and harder to bend, leading the cloth to only wrap around the sphere loosely.

<!-- Show us at least 3 screenshots that document how your cloth falls and folds on itself,

Vary the density as well as ks and describe with words and screenshots how they affect the behavior
of the cloth as it falls on itself. -->
<h2 align="middle">Part 4: Handling self-collisions</h2>
<p>
  In this part, we first implement the hash_position function with the w, h, t provided in the spec, and the fmod function to get the
  closest x, y, z to such 3d box, to get the unique float, we used x + y^2 + z^3, same idea
  as the normal 1d concatenation method. Then we build the spatial map by pushing all point masses into
  certain hash position. Lastly for self collide, we first get the float representation of the current point
  mass we are working on, iterate through all the candidate points from the map with dist != 0 and <= 2 * thickness.
  In this way, we are only considering the candidate points that are close enough and not the current point it self.
  then we accumulate the correction needed for each candidante points. After looping, we take use the average of corrections / simulation_steps
  as the final correction of the our point mass.

  During testing, we realized there are something wrong with our collide function for plane, since the
  offset should not be the same for positive and negative positionsn (one with + and one with -), our original
  solution makes the cloth to go underneath the plane a little bit, which is wrong. After the quick fix, everything
  looks good.
</p>
<p>
  Here we are showing 6 screenshots of how our cloth falls and folds on itself,
  starting with an early, initial self-collision and ending with the cloth at a more restful
  state, with all parameters defaulted.

<p>
  Now we compare the processes from initial self-collision to the a more restful
  state of high=50,000 and low=50 ks below. With a low ks (top), the cloth looks more soft, flexible, and almost
  silk-like. It has many more folds and wave-like creases than the cloth with a high ks. The restful state is more pressed
  to the plane and we can clearly see the shape underneath the top layer. For the high ks (bottom), the cloth feels more stiff and
  not as soft. It also has fewer folds and wave-like creases. The final resting state looks more regular. One interesting fact is that
  such cloth with high ks will tend to unfold itself more (lay on the plane), whereas for ks=50, it takes way longer to have the
  final state being expanded on the plane.

  Next we are looking at density by comparing high density=1500 and low=1.5. The low density
  set is so similar to high ks=50,000, whereas the high density looks close to low ks=50.
  As mentioned in part 2, when density is low, the number of folds and creases is low and more regular, the final state
  spread wider on the plane. With high density (highly affected by external forces), there are many more folds and wave-like
  creases than the cloth with a low density. The restful state is more pressed
  to the plane and we can clearly see the more irregular pattern underneath the top layer.

<h2 align="middle">Part 5: Shaders</h2>
<p>
  This part is quite different from any other tasks in this semester because it teaches us how to use GLSL to shade and and do realistic
  rendering faster. First, we need to explain in our own words what is a shader program and how vertex and fragment shaders work together
  to create lighting and material effects. The shader program written in GLSL, as mentioned ealier, are programs run in GPU with parallelism that do
  graphic related transformation between inputs and outputs for real-time or interactive applications. There are two types of shaders:
  vertex shaders and fragment shaders. Vertex shaders is in charge of vertices related work, namely extracting vertex attributes
  to do position assignment, barycentric coordinates interpolation, normalization, and etc. Fragment shaders works for assigning
  (r,g,b,a) color vector based on the data from the vertices. In other word, it produces and generates the realistic lights and materials
  by settling the pixel values according to vertex information
</p>

<!-- Explain the Blinn-Phong shading model in your own words.
Show a screenshot of your Blinn-Phong shader outputting only
the ambient component, a screen shot only outputting the diffuse component, a screen shot only outputting the specular component,
and one using the entire Blinn-Phong model. -->
<p>
  Then we explain the Blinn-Phong shading model in our own words. To implement the Phong shading, we use
  <pre align="middle">
    L = k_a*I_a + k_d*(I/r^2)*max(0, n·l) + k_s*(I/r^2)*max(0, n·h)^p = L_a + L_d + L_s
  </pre>
  Here the first term L_a is ambient, L_d is diffuse, and L_s is specular reflection. For L_a,
  since the shading will not depend on anything because the incoming light is identical everywhere
  in the scene. L_d with incoming ray l is reflecting lights of equal intensity in all directions.
  Depending on the locations (angle) and distances of light sources, the diffuse term is affected by the light
  falloff. Lastly, the L_s term takes the viewing point into account as well. We calcualte h as the bisector
  of the viewing angle and the light incoming angle, comparing h to the surface normal n when calculating the light.
  With these three simple perceptual approximation of lights, we can complete a simple shading. Here are some
  examples of (1) only the ambient component, (2) only the diffuse component. (3) only the specular component, and
  (4) the entire Blinn-Phong model with all default parameters and k_a = 0.2, Ia = (0.5, 0.5, 0.5), k_d = 0.7,
  k_s = 0.6, and p = 12.0.

  For the bump mapping and displacement mapping on the cloth and on the sphere below,
  we use height = 0.02 and normal = 100.
  With k_a = 0.3, I_a = (0.1, 0.1, 0.1), k_d = 0.5, k_s = 0.4, p = 12.0. For the bumping mapping,
  we only modify the normal vectors in Bump.frag, which makes the lights of the vertex formed according to the height map
  based on u_height_scaling. Using the final n0, we impose the light and shading from the texture given and then use Phong
  shading. This create an illusion of bumping-like texture without changing the actual geometry, as we can tell from 5.9,
  the smooth sphere it self looks the same, and the cloth in 5.10 is still a cloth with no significant geometry changes, its just the
  projection that makes the final result looks like textured.
  In the displacement mapping, however, we used the same fragment shader as the bump.frag, but in addition, we changed the actual
  shape in displacement.vert by scaling the v_position with u_height_scaling. This makes the sphere in 5.11 looks deformed in shape.
  Similarly in 5.12, the geometry of the cloth (see its edges in particular) is changed, with more wigglings and wavy patterns.

  To take a closer look, we use these two shaders again by changing the
  sphere mesh's coarseness, using -o 16 -a 16 and then -o 128 -a 128. All other parameters
  are the same as above. Here -o controls the vertical resolution and -a controls the horizontal resolution.
  so the top row below should have lower quality than the bottom row. However, the bumping -16 and -128 look very
  similar, whereas the displacement looks very different. Focusing on 5.15 and 5.19, clearly with a lower resolution is low,
  vertices of the sphere looks sharp and blocky, with high coarseness, whereas it looks smooth with low coarseness in high resolution.
  This is as expected because we updated the actual position in Displacement.vert, so a higher resolution will reflect on the geometry of
  the sphere itself, instead only effecting the light changes.

  Lastly, for the ec, we implemented a custom shader with displacement and u_texture_4 texture mapping, we use the mirror shading
  texture as the alpha so the cloth looks a little bit transparent with k_a = 0.3, I_a = (0.3, 0.3, 0.3), k_d = 0.5, k_s = 0.4, p = 12.0,
  height = 0.02 and normal = 100.

<h2 align="middle">Collaboration</h2>
<p>
We coded and wrote the write up together, so there's no specific section division.
This project is our favourite one for this semester, and we've really enjoyed working on it.
In terms of the partnership, we are cool with the current situation.
