      <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
    <p>
      In this project, we chose part 1 and part 2 to implement. We ended up with successfully rendering mirror, glass, and microfacet materials.
      For each material, we used different BRDFs to sample and model lights. In part 1, we finished the reflection and refraction function, and looked at
      different bounces and their corresponding outcomes. In part 2, we wrote the Microfacet BRDF function with Beckmann NDF and Importance Sampling.
      One interesting takeaway in this part is the fact that we used Schlick's approximation for the Fresnel term in part 1 for air-dielectric interfaces.
      However, for air-conductor in part 2, we need to calcualte F with eta and k because it is wavelength-dependent. The task 4 in part 2 took us sometimes
      , since we needed to research on how to calculate wi and h. The part where we can use different eta and k to render different conductor materials was a lot of fun.

    <h2 align="middle">Part 1: Mirror and Glass Materials</h2>


        <p>
          For this part, we first implemented BSDF::reflect() w.r.t the z axis by setting x, y of wi to -wo.x and -wo.y, and z to wo.z. We
          used it directly in the mirror sample to get reflectance / abs_cos_theta(*wi) with pdf = 1, and a small offset.
          For RefractionBSDF::sample_f(), we checked wo.z for entering and exiting, and setted eta differently accordingly when there is a valid refraction.
          For glass, we followed the Schlick's approximation to find R0 and R, and used a coin_flip(R) to sample reflection and refraction if
          it is not total internal reflection instead of really separating the incoming light into the reflection and refraction portion.
          It was a little bit hard for us to figure out indices of refraction, but the hint in wikipedia of
          n1 are largely approximated as 1 helped us to solve the problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          As required by the writeup spec, we generated 7 images with at least 64 samples per pixel and 4 samples per light with
          max_ray_depth = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 100 below. Specifically, -t 8 -s 256 -l 4 -m 0 ../dae/sky/CBspheres.dae.
        </p>
        <p>
          The brightnesses of the scenes are increasing as we increase the max_ray_depth.
          When max_ray_depth=0 (Fig 1.1), we have 0-bounce, and therefore only the light source can be seen.
        </p>
        <p>
          With max_ray_depth=1 (Fig 1.2),
          all the effects of the direct illuminations are shown (0 and 1-bounce), and we can observe the environment more comparing to 1.1 with
          the rendered floor, walls, and the reflection of the light source bouncing into the camera.
          However, we can't see detailed reflections on neither the mirror nor the glass objects (their shadows are black as well).
          Comparing to the highlight on the glass(right sphere) to it on the mirror(left),
          we can see some noises and grains on the glass because not all the sampled rays reflected and refracted according to the coin_flip.</p>
      <p>
          Next, for max_ray_depth=2 (Fig 1.3) with (0,1,2-bounce), the scene looks brighter and the ceiling is renderred.
          Both spheres are more detailed, and we can clearly see the reflection from 1-bounce on the mirror (left sphere).
          The glass (right) looks cloudy and grainy again due to the coin_flip on the surface, but it still have the reflection and reflection from
          1-bounce as well. Since there are only 1 round of indirect lighting, all rays got reflected/refracted can't countinue to go out from the glass
          sphere and therefore it doesn't look as transparent. Both shadows look better, but the one for glass is still very grainy.
      </p>
          <p>
          Then, for max_ray_depth=3 (Fig 1.4) with with (0,1,2,3-bounce), we have more indirect lightings. The reflections of ceiling and self-shadow on the mirror sphere are
          more accurate instead of black on 1.3 (the glass sphere reflection looks a little better but still grainy),
          because now the reflection used is with 2-bounce. The glass mirror is transparent and the reflection/refraction on it look clear with
          the white wall behind and the blue wall instead of the entire front frame in 1.3.
        </p>
      <p>
        For max_ray_depth=4 (Fig 1.5). The reflections of ceiling on the mirror sphere and self-shadow looks way more accurate. Intersectingly,
        there's a little glare on the blue wall due to the reflection of the glass sphere, which itself looks brighter as well.
        Finally for max_ray_depth=5 (Fig 1.6) and max_ray_depth=100 (Fig 1.7), the scene looks similar and there's not a lot of imporvement in details
        other than the brightness. Comparing the last two scene, there's almost no different as the stimulation result has converged.

    <h2 align="middle">Part 2: Microfacet Material</h2>
    <p>
    For this part, we implemented the Microfacet model BRDF with Beckmann distribution and importance sampling. Since the macro surface's
    smoothness and glareness are controlled by alpha, and we need to calcualte normal h and its pdf by sampling theta_h and phi_h with NDF = Beckmann distribution,
    they can be fairly different depending on the regions. During the process of coding, we followed the spec to fill out f, F, and D, and for task 4,
    we spent some time researching on how to calcualte needed items:
    we figured out the convertion from theta_h and phi_h to h by looking at the Cartesian coordinate conversions section
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_coordinate_system">here</a>, for wi*, we looked at the hint on piazza and the
    instruction <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5454661/reflection-how-do-i-do-it">here</a> in the sample_f function.
    After generating 2 random numbers, we used it to calcualte the pdf p_wi.
    we setted pdf = 0 and return Vector3D(0.0, 0.0, 0.0) if dot(n, *wi) < 0, and used the outcome p_wi and f(wo, *wi) if the sample is valid.
  </p>

    <p>
      Here is a sequence of 4 images of scene CBdragon_microfacet_au.dae rendered with alpha 0.005, 0.05, 0.25 and 0.5 according to the given
      requirment in the spec. Specifically, we used -t 8 -s 128 -l 1 -m 5 ../dae/sky/CBdragon_microfacet_au.dae. In this case, while we are changing
      alpha, we are essentially changing the roughness. As alpha goes larger, the macro surface looks more diffuse. When alpha = 0.005, the macro surface
      looks very glossy comparing to it with alpha = 0.5.

      Next, we used CBbunny_microfacet_cu.dae with cosine hemisphere sampling and the new importance sampling.
      Specifically, with -t 8 -s 64 -l 1 -m 5 ../dae/sky/CBbunny_microfacet_cu.dae. There are more noises overall with
      cosine hemisphere sampling than with importance sampling because cosine hemisphere sampling weren't following the Beckmann
      normal distribution function for each h, which provided the distribution of microfacets' normals.

      Finally, we renderred CBbunny_microfacet_cu.dae with Silver and Gold, we looked up the eta and k
      <a href="https://refractiveindex.info/?shelf=main&book=Au&page=Johnson">here</a>, with wavelength
      614 nm (red), 549 nm (green) and 466 nm (blue).

      k = 3.2390, 2.4599, 1.8661. Again, we used -t 8 -s 64 -l 1 -m 5 ../dae/sky/CBbunny_microfacet_cu.dae.

We coded and wrote the write up together, so there's no specific section division. This project is hard and long even for a group of two, but in term of the partnership, we are cool with the current situation.
